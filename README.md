This program was born from the tiredness of using Powerpoint/Media player/Quicktime/VLC/Image viewer/whatever... to manage the music and projection of my school Christmas play.

You got a Control Panel at the primary display and do the projection at the secondary.
The Control Panel IS NOT a timeline. It's a media manager where you organize and connect the different media - the Nodes.
There are 6.
Link, Text and Rect are created using the menu.
To use Image, Audio and Video you can also drag and drop the wanted files.

Initially you got 4 tracks. It's important to understand that at each time only one node can be active on each track.

Move nodes with Left click+drag.
Select several with Control+click.
Connect nodes with Right click+drag.
Delete connection and nodes with Right click.
Open node properties window with Double click.

There's some more explanations (I should write a wiki), but for now, play with it. It's easy! Really!!
